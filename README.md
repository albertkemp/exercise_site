# exercise_site
This site is a site that I made aiming to prove exercise easier, without login, payment or app download. This is a VERY basic web app and is not in any way commercial, more for personal use. If anyone does find this site useful it is accessible at https://albertkemp.github.io/exercise_site/. However, it is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3 license and various conditions apply.

# some screenshots
Below are some screenshots of what the web application looks like when used.<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-15 at 10 04 07 am" src="https://github.com/albertkemp/exercise_site/assets/91766342/37a0d41f-efe7-4618-a22b-26cd92b3e3ad">

Overall, this is far from a public scale site and I did it for fun, not for money or any other commercial reason.
