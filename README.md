# exercise_site
This site is a site that I made aiming to prove exercise easier, without login, payment or app download. This is a VERY basic web app and is not in any way commercial, more for personal use. If anyone does find this site useful it is accessible at https://albertkemp.github.io/exercise_site/. However, it is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3 license and various conditions apply.

# some screenshots
Below are some screenshots of what the web application looks like when used.

Overall, this is far from a public scale site and I did it for fun, not for money or any other commercial reason.
